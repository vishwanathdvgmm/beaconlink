## Overview

BeaconLink is an open-source distributed platform for securely deploying, managing, and monitoring workloads across multiple machines.

It provides a unified control plane for infrastructure management while abstracting the underlying execution runtime. BeaconLink is designed around modular components, secure communication, declarative deployments, and operational simplicity.

The platform is built using Go for backend services and React for the web console, following a documentation-first engineering process and modern cloud-native design principles.

The implementation roadmap is documented in:

```text
docs/13-roadmap/
```

Until the first stable release, APIs, protocols, and internal packages may evolve as implementation progresses.

# Design Principles

BeaconLink is built around several engineering principles:

- Simplicity over complexity
- Security by default
- Documentation first
- Stable interfaces
- Modular architecture
- Explicit dependencies
- Operational visibility
- Testability
- Maintainability
- Extensibility

---

# Acknowledgements

BeaconLink is inspired by modern distributed systems, cloud-native engineering practices, and the open-source infrastructure ecosystem. While influenced by established architectural patterns, it is designed as an independent platform with its own implementation, protocol, and operational model.
